        <li>&nbsp;Add eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and stir until completely combined. Set aside.
            (2 large eggs + 1 egg yolk, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)</li>
        <li>&nbsp;In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt.
            (2 ¼ cups (285 g) all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, ½ teaspoon baking powder,

      <h2 class="notes-title">Notes</h2>
      <p class="notes-text">* I like to use half dark and half light brown sugar in this recipe. You can use all light
         or all dark, either will work, but if you use all dark brown sugar the blondies will be a
         bit richer, sweeter, and more moist.</p>
      <p class="notes-text">**If you don't have parchment paper you can lightly grease and flour the sides and bottom 
         of your pan instead. </p>
      <p class="notes-text">***If you use a glass pan it will likely take longer than the suggested time to bake.</p>
