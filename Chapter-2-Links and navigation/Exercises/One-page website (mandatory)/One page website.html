    <h2>Plot Overview</h2><hr>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>In New York City, John Wick is grieving the death of his wife Helen, who had arranged for him to receive a beagle puppy
       to help cope with his loss. A few days later, a group of Russian gangsters, led by Iosef Tarasov, accost John at a gas
       station and fail to intimidate him into selling them his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang.[ii] That night, they break into John's home,
       assault him, kill the puppy, and steal the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but
       the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes it and refuses service. Aurelio informs John that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the 
       boss of New York City's Russian mafia.</p>
    
    <p>Upon learning of his son's actions, Viggo berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. He reveals John was once a hitman in his 
       employ, and was renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the Baba Yaga, a ruthless, relentless "man of focus, commitment,
       and sheer will". After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly impossible task to earn his freedom; 
       he succeeded.</p>
        
    <p>John recovers a concealed stash from his former career that includes weapons and gold coins. He rejects Viggo's attempt to make 
       amends and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John and enlists John's former 
       mentor, Marcus, to kill him. John lodges at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld 
       and where conducting criminal business is forbidden. Winston, the hotel's owner and John's old friend, informs him that Iosef is
       at a nightclub called Red Circle. John infiltrates Red Circle and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Viggo's henchman Kirill
       and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.</p>
        
    <p>As John rests, a hitwoman, Ms. Perkins, sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning 
       shot to alert John, who wakes up and subdues her. Perkins reveals Viggo has doubled the bounty for her to kill John in the hotel 
       and has concealed a high-value stash in a church. John hires another hitman, Harry, to secure Perkins but she kills Harry and escapes.</p>
        
    <p>At the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, 
       John assaults him and his men but is hit by Kirill's car and captured. John tells Viggo he will not stop until Iosef is dead because
       the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus again intervenes to save John, who kills Kirill 
       and threatens Viggo into revealing Iosef's location in a safe house. John attacks the safehouse and kills Iosef. Marcus encourages 
       John to return to his everyday life. Perkins witnesses this and reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo, who has him tortured and killed.
       Viggo calls John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.</p>
        
    <p>Winston has Perkins executed for breaking the Continental's rules, then informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. 
       John races to New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. John, resigned to dying from his injuries, watches on his phone a
       video of Helen telling him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pit bull puppy 
       scheduled to be euthanized before beginning to walk home.</p>

   <p>lnvicta says, "Kinetic, concise, and stylish; John Wick kicks ass'.</p>
   <p>Kitsch says, "John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as "Keanu gets angry and shoots 
      bad guys" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who's a stunt specialist boy does it show because
      the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today's
      action movies, it doesn't use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what's going on.</p>
    <p>CountJonnie says, "It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies. Most movies
       nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories
       that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who 
       aren't present here. Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless
       character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick
       offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But 
       that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, 
       without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending. And for those who
       claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave 
       the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe. If you're tired of movies with forced drama or
       loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.</p>
